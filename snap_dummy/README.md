# snap_dummy

This is a dummy Gleam project for snapshot testing the linter.

## Flow

Place some example code for a new lint rule in the project in a new file.
Then, from the root of `whinge` (the outer project not this dummy one), run the snapshot
tests to verify your lint is working.

To learn how to use the birdie snapshot flow, see their docs: https://hexdocs.pm/birdie/
