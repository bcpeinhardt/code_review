Location Identifier: concat_empty
Rule: NoUnnecessaryStringConcatenation
Error: Unnecessary concatenation with an empty string

You can remove the concatenation with "".

Location Identifier: string_concatenation
Rule: NoUnnecessaryStringConcatenation
Error: Unnecessary concatenation of string literals
Details: Instead of concatenating these two string literals, they can be written as a single one.
For instance, instead of "a" <> "b", you could write that as "ab".

Location Identifier: panic_in_use_call
Rule: NoPanic
Error: Found `panic`
Details: This keyword should almost never be used! It may be useful in initial prototypes and scripts, but its use in a library or production application is a sign that the design could be improved.
With well designed types the type system can typically be used to make these invalid states unrepresentable.
